            Over the centuries, Yumbulagang transformed from a royal residence to a sacred shrine, and eventually to a <strong>Buddhist monastery</strong> during the reign of the 5th Dalai Lama. It enshrines images of ancient kings, Buddhas, and early emperors like <strong>Songtsen Gampo</strong>, who introduced Buddhism and created the Tibetan script.

            <h2>üìç Yarlung Valley</h2> 
            <p> Yumbhulhagang, Tibet‚Äôs first palacemarks the beginning of Tibetan kingship and civilization. Perched above the Yarlung Valley, it embodies the union of myth, governance, and spiritual tradition at the roots of Tibetan identity. 
            </p> 
            <p> 
            Nearly destroyed during China‚Äôs Cultural Revolution, Yumbhulhagang became a symbol of the broader effort to erase Tibet‚Äôs cultural and spiritual heritage following the 1950 occupation. Though later rebuilt, it remains a powerful reminder of the Tibetan people's deep connection to their land and the enduring strength of their identity.

            <h2>üèØ Lhasa</h2> 
            <p> In the 7th century, the capital moved from Yarlung to Lhasa under King Songtsen Gampo, who established it as the spiritual and political heart of Tibet. The Potala Palace and Jokhang Temple transformed the city into a center of governance, Buddhism, and pilgrimage. </p> 
            <p> For centuries, Lhasa was the beating heart of Tibetan life. But following Chinese occupation and the 1959 uprising, it became a place of both resistance and repression ‚Äî a city where Tibetan identity remains deeply rooted, yet constantly challenged. </p>

            <p> After fleeing into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lama established the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India. Though outside Tibet‚Äôs borders, Dharamsala has become a third symbolic capital ‚Äî a refuge where culture, language, and faith continue to flourish against all odds. </p> <p> From this hillside town, generations of Tibetans in exile have preserved their identity, taught their history, and sustained a vision of return. Dharamsala stands as a global reminder that while Tibet‚Äôs land may be occupied, its spirit remains unbroken. </p>

         <h2>Welcome to Play My Game</h2>
         <p>This game is about a Tibetan boy named Tenzin, who, after fleeing to Dharamsala and learning to code, creates a website called "Voices of Tibet", a site where Tibetans can share stories so that their homeland is never forgotten.</p>
         <p>This is a fun game where you must use the arrow buttons to move Tenzin so that he may collect his friends, who help him create his website, his chip, which holds all the data that allows him to visit the site, the wires to ensure his computor is working and stable, and a computor, so that he may create and edit his site.</p>

        <h2></h2>
        <p> From the sacred heights of Yumbhulhagang in the Yarlung Valley to the grandeur of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet‚Äôs historical journey reflects a profound evolution ‚Äî from mythic beginnings to a unified kingdom grounded in spiritual leadership and cultural identity. The 7th-century move to Lhasa under King Songtsen Gampo marked a turning point in Tibet‚Äôs political and religious life, with the Potala becoming a lasting symbol of that union. Today, as the map traces these historic paths, it also points beyond ‚Äî to Dharamsala in exile, where the spirit of Tibet continues to thrive through memory, resistance, and renewal. </p>
