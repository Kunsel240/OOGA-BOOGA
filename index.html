            Over the centuries, Yumbulagang transformed from a royal residence to a sacred shrine, and eventually to a <strong>Buddhist monastery</strong> during the reign of the 5th Dalai Lama. It enshrines images of ancient kings, Buddhas, and early emperors like <strong>Songtsen Gampo</strong>, who introduced Buddhism and created the Tibetan script.

            <h2>Àö‚ä±ü™∑‚ä∞ÀöGyantse</h2> 
            <p> Gyantse,Tibet is where Tenzin was born and raised as well as where his father had first taught him how to code and the beauty of computor science. Even though he was only five years old at the time, he understood more than other kids his age. Therefore, Gyantse is where Tenzin's love of coding began. 
            </p> 
            <p> 
           In tibetan, Gyantse means "peak of victory", and because of the fact that this is where he first learned to code, Gyantse always felt like home to Tenzin and was his inspiration to pursue his dream of creating "Voices of Tibet" in the first place. The memories of his homeland encouraged him to achieve ùò©ùò™ùò¥ peak of victory.

            <p> Tenzin and his family chose Dharamsala in particular since most of their friends and family had also moved there. And also because it reminded them of home, because of the fact that it was nicknamed "Little Tibet". </p>

            <p> Tenzin also came to San Francisco in particular because he would be  paid the most money there (which he would use to buy a new computor) but also because the beach reminded him of the Dal lake near Dharamsala and the Yamdrok lake near Gyantse.</p>

         <h2>Welcome to Play My Game</h2>
         <p>This game is about a Tibetan boy named Tenzin, who, after fleeing to Dharamsala and learning to code, creates a website called "Voices of Tibet", a site where Tibetans can share stories so that their homeland is never forgotten.</p>
         <p>This is a fun game where you must use the arrow buttons to move Tenzin so that he may collect his friends, who help him create his website, his chip, which holds all the data that allows him to visit the site, the wires to ensure his computor is working and stable, and a computor, so that he may create and edit his site.</p>

        <h2></h2>
        <p> From the sacred heights of Yumbhulhagang in the Yarlung Valley to the grandeur of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet‚Äôs historical journey reflects a profound evolution ‚Äî from mythic beginnings to a unified kingdom grounded in spiritual leadership and cultural identity. The 7th-century move to Lhasa under King Songtsen Gampo marked a turning point in Tibet‚Äôs political and religious life, with the Potala becoming a lasting symbol of that union. Today, as the map traces these historic paths, it also points beyond ‚Äî to Dharamsala in exile, where the spirit of Tibet continues to thrive through memory, resistance, and renewal. </p>
